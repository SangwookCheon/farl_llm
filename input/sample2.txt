  Suggested delta: +45 minutes/week
  Target value: 60 minutes/week

Step 2:
  Variable: Sugary_drinks_per_day
  Baseline value: 2.0 drinks/day
  Suggested delta: -2.0
  Target value: 0 drinks/day

Step 3:
  Variable: LBXSTR (Triglycerides, mg/dL)
  Baseline value: 330
  Suggested delta: -60
  Target value: 270

Step 4:
  Variable: ALQ130 (Average drinks per drinking day)
  Baseline value: 4–5 drinks/day
  Suggested delta: -2
  Target value: 2–3 drinks/day

Step 5:
  Variable: BMXBMI (Body mass index, kg/m2)
  Baseline value: 33.9
  Suggested delta: -1.2
  Target value: 32.7

Final DBS after applying all 5 steps (simulated): 0.51
