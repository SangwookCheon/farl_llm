RL ACTION PLAN
# 5-step sequence of variable edits produced by Actor-Critic policy

Step 1:
  Variable: MVPA (weekly minutes, derived from PAD790Q/U and PAD800)
  Baseline value: 40 minutes/week
  Suggested delta: +30 minutes/week
  Target value: 70 minutes/week

Step 2:
  Variable: LBXGH (HbA1c, %)
  Baseline value: 8.4
  Suggested delta: -0.7
  Target value: 7.7

Step 3:
  Variable: LBXSTR (Triglycerides, mg/dL)
  Baseline value: 260
  Suggested delta: -40
  Target value: 220

Step 4:
  Variable: BMXBMI (Body mass index, kg/m2)
  Baseline value: 35.9
  Suggested delta: -1.5
  Target value: 34.4

Step 5:
  Variable: “Sugary_drinks_per_day” (behavioural variable derived from dietary history)
  Baseline value: 1.5 drinks/day
  Suggested delta: -1.5
  Target value: 0 drinks/day

Final DBS after applying all 5 steps (simulated): 0.63


PATIENT CONTEXT
- Mobility: Uses a power wheelchair outside the home because of knee osteoarthritis and neuropathic foot pain. Can stand and pivot for a few minutes with support but cannot walk more than a few steps.
- Daily routine: Retired; spends most of the day at home watching TV or using a tablet. Sleeps around 6 hours/night with frequent awakenings.
- Social situation: Lives with spouse; spouse does most of the cooking and grocery shopping. One adult child lives in another city.
- Financial situation: Household income-to-poverty ratio 1.5; reports needing to “watch food costs” and prefers affordable ingredients and no gym membership.
- Eating pattern (self-report): Typically eats 2 main meals and 1–2 snacks per day. Drinks about 1–2 sugary sodas most days of the week. Often eats dinner late (after 9 pm).
- Health beliefs and barriers:
  - Worries about low blood sugar if she “eats less,” though she has not had documented severe hypoglycemia.
  - Feels intimidated by the idea of “exercise,” but is open to trying short, chair-based movements if clearly explained.
  - Rates her overall health as “fair” and is concerned about future kidney problems because of high urine ACR.
- Healthcare access: Has a usual community health center she visits every 3–4 months. Has a blood pressure monitor at home but does not check regularly.
